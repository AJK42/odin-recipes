    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>COMBINE ½ cup coconut aminos, ¼ cup rice vinegar, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 ½ teaspoons Chinese Five Spice powder, and ¼ tsp salt in a small bowl.</li>
        <li>MIX wings and combined sauce in either a reusable zip-top bag or bowl. Cover or seal and refrigerate to marinate for at least 30 minutes, up to overnight. Discard marinade.</li>
        <li>COMBINE remaining ½ cup coconut aminos, ¼ cup rice vinegar, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 ½ teaspoon Chinese Five Spice powder, and ¼ tsp salt in another small bowl and set aside. This will be your glaze.</li>
        <li>AIR FRY wings by spraying a tray with cooking oil and laying a single layer of wings in basket or tray. This may need to be done in batches. Air fry at 350 °F for 8 minutes. Brush with glaze, flip, and brush with glaze again. Air fry at 400 °F for 5-7 minutes, until crispy.</li>
        <li>COOK in the oven by spraying a cooling rack with cooking oil and setting it into a rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment or foil. Lay wings in a single layer. Broil on LOW for 8 minutes. Brush with glaze, flip, and brush with glaze again. Broil for an additional 5-7 minutes, until crispy.</li>
        <li>COMBINE remaining glaze with 1 teaspoon arrowroot or potato starch. Cook over low heat until slightly thickened. You can thin this down with additional coconut aminos if it gets too thick.</li>
        <li>GLAZE cooked wings and top with any desired optional toppings. Enjoy!</li>
